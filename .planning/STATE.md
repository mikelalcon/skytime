# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-26)

**Core value:** A consultant team can take an extension catalog and a customer brief, write a `.star` file, and have a production-grade durable workflow running on Temporal — without touching Go and without giving up Temporal's retry/timeout/child-workflow guarantees.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Type Spine + Extension Contract + Parser/Bridge Foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Type Spine + Extension Contract + Parser/Bridge Foundations)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-26 — Roadmap created with 6 phases, 55/55 v1 requirements mapped

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Starlark over CEL/custom DSL — lambdas + struct injection give expressive data access without string-parsing risk
- Init: Single generic Temporal activity — avoids per-extension activity registration; enables block-batched I/O
- Init: Extensions return `ActionRef` intents (Command Pattern) — keeps parse phase pure, lets interpreter route/batch/mock from one place
- Roadmap: Phase 7 production-hardening from research deferred to v1.x — no v1 requirements landed there
- Roadmap: Phase 1 intentionally large (22 reqs across DSL/EXT/PARSE) — splitting would create co-evolution hazards between primitives, extension contract, and parser/bridge

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 3 entry-gate decision:** Lambda serialization across Temporal history (custom `DataConverter` vs. re-parse-on-start) must be resolved before any interpreter code is written. Default fallback if spike is inconclusive: option (b) re-parse on workflow start with `workflow.SideEffect`, `LambdaID` keys in history, file-content-hash cache.
- **Requirement count discrepancy:** REQUIREMENTS.md header states "51 total" but enumerated requirements sum to 55 (DSL:10 + EXT:6 + PARSE:6 + INTRP:7 + ACT:6 + WORK:3 + VAL:3 + TEST:5 + CLI:5 + EX:4). All 55 are mapped to phases; the header line should be reconciled at the next /gsd:transition.
